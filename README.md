# Versions 1.5D & 1.5DE - August 12, 2021

A better routing of the boards has been carried out and a power LED has been added.

Version 1.5DE has a rear expansion port.

# Version 1.4D - December 1, 2020

Started in April 2020, I finally got the expected results and created a fully operational and enhanced clone
of the Romantic Robot Multiface 3 for ZX Spectrum +3 computers.

The following project is a modified and improved version of the Multiface 3 interface originally designed by Romantic Robot UK LTD.
The Spanish company Hard Micro made, back in 1988, a clone of the Multiface 3. Since then there have been no more recreations that I know of.

The Multiface 3 is a multipurpose interface designed for ZX Spectrum +3 computers that, among many other functionalities,
allows us to make backup copies of programs or games on tape or disk. If used on the + 2A / + 2B models, such copies can only be made on tape.

The main changes compared to the original model are:

- Dual ROM based on a W27E257
- PAL16L8 replaced by GAL16V8B
- RAM 6264 or 62256.
- RESET button.
- Decoupling capacitors for all IC's.
- Horizontal EDGE connector.
- PCB designed to put inside a printed 3D case.
- Kempston Joystick interface (can be enabled or disabled)

# Notes:

To **use MF3 with a Gotek** we must change the next lines in the **FF.cfg** file

- track-change = **realtime**
- write-drain = **realtime**

# Original introduction

MULTIFACE 3 is a multi-purpose interface designed exclusively for the
SPECTRUM+3. It provides fully automatic and universal back-up/transfer of
48/128K programs from tape to disk, disk to tape, tape to tape and disk to
disk. It also incorporates a comprehensive toolkit enabling you to
study/modify/develop software. MULTIFACE 3 can copy screens to printer in
hi-res modes and it extends the use of DOS in 48 SPECTRUM mode. MULTIFACE
is menu-driven, fully error-trapped with on-screen prompts and it largely
uses a system of one-touch commands. It is very easy to use and does not
really need a separate written manual. Nonetheless, the following few pages
should help you to understand every aspect of MULTIFACE 3 operations so that
you can use it to its fullest possible potential.
